(1) Algorithm for the sum of the elements of an array

INPUT		PROCESSING			OUTPUT
Array of ints	Loop through array	
		
		Add the number at each		Sum of the array values
		index to an int variable
			             
Control Structures: Sequence, Repetition
Variables: int, int []

Loop through array
Add the number at each index of an array to an int variable initalized to 0.
Return the int variable, which is also the sum of the array

[1, 2, 3]
sum = element at index 0 + element at index 1 + element at index 2 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

[5, 10]
sum = element at index 0 + element at index 1 = 5 + 10 = 15

(2) Algorithm for the mean of the elements of an array

INPUT		PROCESSING			OUTPUT
Array of ints	Loop through array	
		
		Add the number at each
		index to an int variable
		
		Divide the value of the		Mean of the array values		
		int variable by the length 
		of the array
			             
Control Structures: Sequence, Repetition
Variables: int, int []

Loop through array
Add the number at each index of an array to an int variable initalized to 0.
Divide the int variable by the length of the array, which will output the mean of the elements. 

[1, 2, 3]
mean = (element at index 0 + element at index 1 + element at index 2) / length of array
= (1 + 2 + 3)/3 = 6/3 = 2

[6, 10]
mean = (element at index 0 + element at index 1) / length of array
= (6 + 10)/2 = 16/2 = 8
